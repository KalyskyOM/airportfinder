# AirportFinder Android App Context

## Project Overview
AirportFinder is an Android application that helps users find airports near a given location. The app allows users to input coordinates in various formats (DMS, Decimal, GPS) and search for nearby airports within a specified radius.

## Current Status
- App builds and installs successfully
- UI renders correctly with no crashes
- Coordinate input system supports multiple formats
- Airport data is loaded from CSV file in assets

## Fixed Issues
- Restored valid gradle-wrapper.jar file (was corrupted at 554 bytes)
- Fixed quoting error in gradlew script
- Added missing import for EditText in MainActivity.java

## Core Functionality
- Input coordinates in multiple formats (DMS, Decimal, GPS)
- Specify search radius in nautical miles
- Find and display nearby airports from database
- Filter airports by size (small, medium, large)

## Technical Implementation
- CSV data loading via AsyncTask
- Coordinate format conversion utilities
- Distance calculation using haversine formula
- UI state management for different coordinate input formats

## Next Steps
- Verify airport search functionality works correctly
- Test coordinate input validation
- Ensure proper error handling for invalid inputs
- Optimize airport data loading performance

## Future Enhancements
1. User enters ICAO code → Creates airport bubble above input
2. Multiple airports can be selected → All show as bubbles above input
3. "Get Airport Info" → Shows sample weather data in rows
4. "Generate and upload PDFs" → Creates professional aviation reports and after confirmation upload to dropbox
5. Dropbox setup via modal guide →user token setup

## Design Specifications
- **Color Scheme**: Aviation blue primary, green for success actions, purple for PDF generation
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts suitable for aviation professionals
- **Modal Design**: Exact styling with rounded corners, proper button colors, error message display
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly buttons, proper spacing, responsive layout
